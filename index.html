                                Canada has many modern, multicultural cities, each with its own distinct personality. 
                                Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver are possibly the best-known, but there are so many others that 
                                highlight different aspects of Canada, such as its maritime culture, mountainous landscape, 
                                French history, or its indigenous people. Each city is delightful for different reasons. In addition, 
                                Canadian cities are generally much smaller than the biggest counterparts in the United States, so they 
                                are easy to navigate. Canadian people, even in big cities, tend to be friendly to strangers, and crime is relatively low.

                                Few countries boast the number and range of natural wonders that Canada does. With more coastline than any other country, 
                                mountain ranges, lakes, forests, arctic lands and even a small amount of desert, Canada has a diverse landscape full of surprises.
                                Some of Canada's most spectacular and popular natural attractions are the Canadian Rocky Mountain parks, Dinosaur Provincial Park, 
                                Nahanni National Park Reserve, Cabot Trail, Niagara Falls, and a multitude of scenic drives.

                            <img src="images/affordability.jpg" style="width: 20%; display: block; margin: auto;">
                                Canada is an affordable vacation choice. Historically the Canadian dollar is worth slightly less than the U.S. dollar, so prices in Canada generally seem reasonable to travelers.
